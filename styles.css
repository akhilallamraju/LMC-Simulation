       CSS moves elements by their top-left corner, not their centre.
       Therefore, to properly align elements, half of the element's width & height must be subtracted from the movement. 
       This is achieved using the translate function.
       The -ve %page means that the element would be transformed up & left rather than down & right
       (Webpage coordinates start from the top-right corner so transformations woulf be down & right by default). */
